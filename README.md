## Extraction-2_Movie_Reviews_Analysis

### Introduction
This assignment involves scraping IMDb website to extract reviews of the latest Netflix movie 'Extraction-2' using Selenium and other libraries/tools
in Python. The collected data was then subjected to data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, sentiment analysis, and text analysis. Additionally,
sentiment prediction was performed using Naive Bayes machine learning algorithms. The purpose of this project was to gain insights into the
audience response to the movie.

### Steps Taken
1. Web Scraping: Utilized Selenium and Python libraries to scrape IMDb website for 'Extraction-2' movie reviews.
2. Data Cleaning: Cleaned the collected data to remove irrelevant information, handle missing values, and eliminate noise.
3. Data Preprocessing: Processed the text data by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and special characters.
4. Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, distribution of reviews, and trends.
5. Sentiment Analysis: Utilized natural language processing techniques to determine polarity and subjectivity of reviews.
6. Text Analysis: Created word clouds and distribution plots to visually represent frequent words and sentiments.
7. Sentiment Prediction: Applied Naive Bayes machine learning algorithms to predict sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral).
8. Insights and Conclusions: Derived meaningful insights from the analysis to gauge the overall response of the online community.

### Tools and Libraries Used
1. Python for coding and analysis
2. Selenium for web scraping
3. Natural language processing libraries for text analysis
4. Machine learning libraries for sentiment prediction
5. Data visualization tools for graphical representation
